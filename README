This repository contains configuration files for the UCLALES-SALSA
model to reproduce experiments published in scientific journals.
The cases are divided in branches named according to the corresponding
publication (e.g. Tonttila_etal_2016_Sc), that can be fetched individually
via 
  >> git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/UCLALES-SALSA/CONFIGURATION-FILES

In simple cases, these branches contain the *runles* runscript file,
and a *sound-in* input profile, that should be used to replace the
ones in the bin-directory of UCLALES-SALSA. If more elaborate 
procedures are required, this will be documented for each case.
